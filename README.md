## qmlls (LSP)

The `qmlls` binary should be installed locally from your QT install.
See [this documentation](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qtqml-tooling-qmlls.html#configuration-file) for configuration.

### Installation

#### MacOS

Make sure you have `qmlls` available in your `$PATH`. If you have installed Qt using the online installer you may need to do that manually.

The simplest way to achieve that is by adding this line at the end of your .zshrc file:

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:/Users/$USER/Qt/6.8.0/macos/bin
```

This assumes the version of Qt you have installed is 6.8.0.

#### Linux

On Linux in most cases you can just install qmlls by using your package manger.

##### Ubuntu

```bash
sudo apt install qt6-declarative-dev-tools
```

##### Fedora

```bash
sudo dnf install qt6-qtdeclarative-devel
```

##### Arch

```bash
sudo pacman -S qt6-declarative
```

##### Void Linux

```bash
sudo xbps-install qt6-declarative-tools
```

Void installs `qmlls` to `/usr/lib/qt6/bin/qmlls` so you either need to symlink it to `/usr/bin/qmlls` or just add it to your `$PATH` like so:

```bash
echo "export PATH=\$PATH:/usr/lib/qt6/bin" >> ~/.bashrc
```

### Configure LSP Arguments
For qmlls to recognize modules in your `QML_IMPORT_PATH` you can add the `-E` argument to your settings like so:

```json
{
  "lsp": {
    "qml": {
      "binary": {
        "arguments": ["-E", "additional-args"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Configure Build Directory

For qmlls to recognize your QML modules you have to specify the build directory of your project.
The simplest way to do that is by specifying it in a file called `.qmlls.ini` in your project root like so:

```ini
[General]
buildDir=path/to/build/dir
```

Then after building your project once all errors regarding "module not found" should be resolved.
